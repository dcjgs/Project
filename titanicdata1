1.Write a pig script find the average age of male and female persons died in the titanic tragedy


titanic = load '/pig/TitanicData.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (Passengerid:int, Survived:int, Pclass:int, Name, Sex:chararray, Age:int, Sibsp:int, Parch:int, Ticket:chararray, Fare:float, Cabin:chararray, Embarked:chararray);


fil_titanic = filter titanic by Survived == 1;


male = filter fil_titanic by Sex == 'male';


female = filter fil_titanic by Sex == 'female';


grpm = group male all;


grpf = group female all;


orderm = foreach grpm generate AVG(male.Age);


orderf = foreach grpf generate AVG(female.Age);


dump orderm;  


dump orderf;

2.Write a pig script to find the number of people died and survived in each class


titanic = load '/user/acadgild/titanicdata.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (Passengerid:int, Survived:int, Pclass:int, Name, Sex:chararray, Age:int, Sibsp:int, Parch:int, Ticket:chararray, Fare:float, Cabin:chararray, Embarked:chararray);


dead = filter titanic by Survived == 0;
survived = filter titanic by survived == 1;




grpd = group dead by Pclass;


grps = group survived by Pclass;


orderd = foreach grpd generate COUNT(dead);


orders = foreach grps generate COUNT(survived);


dump orderd;  


dump orders;
